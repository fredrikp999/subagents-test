# The Swedish giant quietly powering your smartphone calls

Most people have never heard of Ericsson AB. Yet chances are, your last phone call traveled through their equipment.

This 149-year-old Swedish company doesn't make phones anymore. Instead, they build the invisible infrastructure that makes modern communication possible. And right now, they're racing to win the 5G revolution.

## From telegraph repair shop to telecom titan

Back in 1876, Lars Magnus Ericsson started fixing telegraphs in a small Stockholm workshop. Within two years, he was making his own telephone equipment. That scrappy beginning launched what would become one of the world's telecommunications powerhouses.

Today, Ericsson employs 100,000 people across 180 countries. They own over 60,000 patents, including the technology behind Bluetooth. Their fingerprints are on nearly every major telecom breakthrough of the past century.

In 2009, they launched the world's first commercial 4G network. Now they're betting everything on 5G.

## The 5G gold rush is here

The numbers tell an incredible story. Global 5G subscriptions hit 2.3 billion by late 2024 – that's 25% of all mobile users worldwide. By 2027, Ericsson predicts 5G will overtake 4G entirely.

This isn't just about faster downloads. 5G enables everything from remote surgery to self-driving cars. Service providers could capture $131 billion in new digital revenues by 2030 if they play their cards right.

Ericsson is locked in fierce competition with Nokia and Huawei for this massive market. They've secured over 200 commercial 5G launches globally, making them one of the top three players in the space.

## Innovation at breakneck speed

The company isn't resting on past achievements. In early 2025, they unveiled 130 new radio products designed to slash energy consumption by 30% while cutting carbon footprint in half.

Their latest Indoor Fusion Unit delivers gigabit 5G speeds in compact hardware. The Interleaved Antenna combines multiple technologies in a single footprint. These aren't just incremental improvements – they're the building blocks of tomorrow's networks.

Ericsson is also diving deep into AI. They offer over 20 cloud-native AI applications spanning network operations. As telecom networks become more complex, artificial intelligence becomes essential for managing them efficiently.

## Challenges in a shifting market

Success hasn't come easy recently. Rising interest rates and shifting demand patterns created headwinds throughout 2023 and 2024. The company has faced the challenge of maintaining R&D investment while managing costs.

Competition remains brutal. Huawei dominates the Chinese market, while Nokia pushes hard in other regions. Each player brings unique strengths to the table.

But Ericsson has weathered storms before. They've survived two world wars, multiple economic downturns, and countless technology shifts. Their 149-year track record suggests they know how to adapt.

## The invisible empire

Here's what makes Ericsson fascinating: they're everywhere but nowhere. You can't buy their products at Best Buy. Most consumers never see their logo. Yet their equipment probably handled your last video call, GPS navigation, or mobile payment.

This invisible presence gives them enormous influence. As 5G networks expand globally, Ericsson's technology choices will shape how billions of people communicate for the next decade.

The Swedish telegraph repair shop has come a long way. Today, they're not just connecting people – they're building the nervous system of the digital world.

Whether they'll maintain their position as a 5G leader depends on execution, innovation, and a bit of luck. But one thing's certain: the next time you make a call, there's a good chance it'll travel through Swedish engineering that traces back to a Stockholm workshop from 1876.
