### Integration points

### Data storage and privacy

Article content is stored as markdown files with metadata managed through JSON manifests, ensuring version control and easy content management. User data collection is minimal, focusing on basic analytics and optional newsletter subscriptions. All data handling complies with privacy regulations including GDPR and CCPA requirements.

### Scalability and performance

The React-based architecture supports efficient content delivery through static site generation and CDN integration. The current markdown-based content system scales effectively for hundreds of articles. Performance optimization includes image compression, code splitting, and lazy loading of non-critical resources.

### Potential challenges

- **Content discovery**: As the article library grows, users may struggle to find relevant content without robust search and categorization
- **Performance at scale**: Loading times may degrade with larger article volumes requiring optimization strategies
- **SEO competition**: Competing with established technology publications for search visibility requires ongoing SEO efforts
